Here's a sample "README.md" file for your Dream Visualizer project, which utilizes Unsplash for image sourcing:

 Dream Visualizer

 Overview
The Dream Visualizer is a Python application that allows users to transform their dreams and thoughts into visual collages. By inputting descriptive text, the application fetches relevant images from Unsplash and compiles them into an artistic collage, providing a creative representation of the user's imagination.

 Features
- **Image Fetching**: Retrieves images based on user-defined keywords from Unsplash API.
- **Collage Creation**: Generates collages using the fetched images.
- **Customizable Layouts**: Supports multiple collage layouts, including grid and stacked formats.
- **Image Filters**: Applies artistic filters to enhance the visual appeal of the collage.
- **Dream Reports**: Provides interpretations and insights based on common dream symbols.
